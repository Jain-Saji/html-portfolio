<h1>The Best Movies Of All Time</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Movies is a work of visual art that uses moving images combined with sound to visualize a story to the audience. They
are used to communicate ideas to the people . Here are some  of the movies which I have liked so far and that I think are 
 the best. </p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Avengers Endgame</b></li>
    <p>This movie is one of the best movie made by marvel of all time. It was a time when marvel was at its peak. The movie 
        showcases the final fight of the Avengers with thanos. It was pure goosebumps when we saw Captain America lift the 
        mjolnir for the first time . Though the avengers won but it was at a cost. </p>
    <li><b>2018</b></li>
    <p>The story of the movie is happening during the heavy flood that almost swallowed  kerala  during 2018. Since it is a 
        malayalam movie it clearly showed all the events that happened during that time. The movie was well received by the 
        people as the movie was able to capture the emotions of the people very much.</p>
    <li><b>Iam Kathalan</b></li>
    <p>This movie showcases the hero who was insulted by his lover's father taking revenge on him. By taking I do not mean 
        physically but by hacking his buisness.The actor who was a Btech student interested in hacking professsion tries to 
        take out her lover's father. Though it does not deal with high levels of hacking it is still interesting to watch.</p>
